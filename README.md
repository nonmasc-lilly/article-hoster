# article-host-project

This is a lil article hoster server project that one day I will hopefully have
finished. It is written in C and will have some sort of html javascript client.
My goal feature set is pretty small but have faith in me to screw it up lol:

- article file storage
- article file fetch over http 1.1
- simple account system with saved articles
- relatively performant (it better be its being written in C)
